Welcome to VitaDock Plus.

Please set your dock output resolution before use. It will affect performance. 1280x720 @ 60Hz is recommended in most scenarios.

Select OK to get rid of this message if you have a mouse, keyboard, or GPIO buttons otherwise it will go away on next boot (unplug and replug power cable).

How to use:
-For video output connect your PlayStation Vita to the dock (Raspberry Pi). Make sure you have Xerpi's vita-udcd-uvc plugin installed on your Vita first. The link to vita-udcd-uvc and some recommended plugins will be on the VitaDock Plus release page. 

-The dock is set up for native playback at 30fps by default but if you would like to switch to the lower resolution 60fps mode you can do so from the VitaDock Plus menu. You can access this menu by clicking the PlayStation logo icon in the bottom right with a mouse, by pressing Ctl + Esc on a keyboard, or with GPIO buttons.

-For audio output from the PlayStation Vita system to your TV you can use an AUX cable from your Vita directly to your TV, you can connect your Vita to Bluetooth on the dock, or you can configure an AUX input to the dock. You can switch between audio modes and configure them in Menu -> Options.

-For more detailed information and advanced features see the VitaDock Plus release page.
